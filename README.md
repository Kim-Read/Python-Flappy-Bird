# Python-Flappy-Bird
I decided to delve into the world of pygame to understand some of the elements and use them to enable me to create my own Flappy Bird game.

## Work in progress
- Created the initial animation elements and added keyboard response.
- Added collision checks and upper/lower limit checks for the bird.
- Added rotation to the bird and animation to make the bird's wings flap.
  
### Next Steps
- Get chatGPT to create the same game and compare my code against it's code to see the difference.
- Create different variations of the game.
